**What are Processing Transactions?**

**	**

Credit card companies take approximately 48 hours to clear a payment before paying out. After you teach a lesson, your clientâ€™s card will be charged for the amount of that lesson. 

That charge will remain in your pending balance until it is cleared by the credit card company.  You will be paid for that lesson once it is a cleared transaction.
