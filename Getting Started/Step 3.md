The billing system is the heart of what makes Fons work so well. Fons’ billing system is the most effective way to run your teaching business, while eliminating administrative tasks and stresses.

**Charges**
All confirmed lessons are billed just after each lesson ends. Your student receives an email receipt, and the charge is shown in your list of recent transactions on the billing page. You can click on Charges to find more information, or issue a refund.

**Deposits**

Charges usually clear between 24-72 hours, and are transferred directly to your bank account each day. By clicking into your deposits chart or the ongoing tally of deposits, you can see a list of each deposit to your bank account, and the lessons that made up each deposit.

Credit Card Processing Fees - Credit card fees are currently 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, plus .5% for each transfer to your bank account. Fons takes nothing from credit card fees, these are simply the rates the card companies charge us.

**Refunds**
If you click on a transaction, you’ll find the refund feature, which allows you to refund part or all the charge if necessary. Note: Refunds cost nothing to you or to your customers. However, if you you issue a refund on a transaction that has already been deposited to your bank, the refund will come out of your next deposit.
