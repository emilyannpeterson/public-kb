**Send Adoption Email**
First off, send a letter to inform your current clients that you’ll be using Fons to manage all of your billing and scheduling starting on a date of your choosing. This informs clients that you are adopting Fons to improve their customer experience and make lessons better. Here are sample letters for both current and new clients. Feel free to adjust the copy as necessary.

*Letter to New Clients*
Hello!

Thank you so much for choosing to study (guitar) with me. I’d like to invite you to create a Fons account to manage all of the scheduling and billing for our lessons. The Fons app is available for web and mobile, and makes the administrative side of taking lessons a cinch.

Setup your account with a just a username, a password, and a credit card. Then we can schedule, confirm, and cancel your lessons. Your credit card will be billed after each scheduled lesson, and you get a receipt emailed to you.

It’s really that easy. No more writing checks, forgetting to pay, or worrying about how many lesson days there are in a month.

Here’s how it will work.

You will receive an email from me inviting you to set up a Fons student account. You can create your account online, and then download the app from the Apple store for your iPhone. The app works for both web and mobile. So, you don’t need to download the app on your phone, you can just use the web if you’d like. The iPhone app does look really awesome though!

If you’ve got any questions, please let me know. You can call me on [NUMBER HERE] or fire me an email.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

*Letter to Current Clients*
Hey Everyone!

I just wanted to let you know that I’ll be changing our billing system and how we schedule lessons to save you time and a lot of hassle.

From [DATE HERE], I’d like to move you over to a new system called “Fons”. Switching to Fons will save you the hassle of paying each month and allows you to easily schedule, reschedule or cancel lessons.

Switching to Fons will save you the hassle of paying each month and allows you to easily schedule, reschedule or cancel lessons.

Instead of being billed each month like we’ve always done, Fons will store a credit card on file, and charge your card after each scheduled lesson. It’s really easy. No more writing checks, or worrying about how many lesson days there are in a month.

You can also contact me through Fons to change, cancel or add lessons.

Here’s how it will work.

You will receive an email from me inviting you to set up a Fons student account. You can create your account online, and then download the app from the Apple store for your iPhone. The app works for both web and mobile. So, you don’t need to download the app on your phone, you can just use the web if you’d like. The iPhone app does look really awesome though!

If you’ve got any questions, please let me know. You can call me on [NUMBER HERE] or fire me an email.

**Add Your Clients**

* Add each of your current clients to your Fons account. Adjust their lesson durations and rates if different than your defaults.
* For clients that do not have existing or recurring lessons scheduled, go ahead and send their invitations to Fons.
* For clients that do have existing or recurring lesson times, follow these steps, lesson times will be waiting for them to confirm when they create their Fons account:
* * Keep the send invite box unchecked and save client.
* * Create their appointment in your schedule, and select the recurrence if it’s a regular appointment.
* * Then return to client profile and send the invite.

_Note: When a client confirms one lesson in a recurring lesson series, all of the appointments in that series are confirmed. Recurring appointments are automatically generated months in advance. This allows you and your clients the ability to go into Fons schedule to cancel lessons for vacations or any other reason necessary._

**Send Invitations / Resend**
Last step, is to go through all of your clients and make sure invites have been sent. If the invite has been sent, a timestamp will appear next to the send invite box. You can resend an invite any time by rechecking the box and saving. Inevitably, some of your clients will require more than one invite before signing up!

*That’s it! Your clients are confirmed and scheduled. Your teaching business is ready to rock!*
