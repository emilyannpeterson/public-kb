The five steps on this Get Started page will help you get your Fons account set up according to our recommended best practices, to get you back to teaching as quickly and easily as possible. You can come back to this page at any time by clicking the Get Started tab in the navigation bar. This tab will remain in your navigation until all of the steps are complete.

To begin, let's get you set up with the mobile Fons app, and then get your Fons Profile set up. Your Profile includes your teaching preferences as well as the personal information that your clients will see, so it's important to spend a few minutes getting it set up to your liking.

**Add Your Organization Default**

* First, double check the organization name, email, and phone number are correct. This is the name your clients will see when they book lessons.
* Hourly Rate - Enter your current hourly rate for new clients. Note that you can adjust each clientâ€™s bill rate individually to account for rate changes or grandfathering.
* Default Lesson Time - Enter the optimal duration of your lessons. Lesson times can be adjusted for each client.
* Cancellation Policy - Your cancellation policy determines how much time your client has to cancel a lesson without being charged for that lesson. Your clients will agree to the terms of your cancellation policies twice when signing up for a Fons account. If a client cancels outside of your window, you will be notified to confirm the cancellation, and the cancelled appointment will be removed from your schedule. If a client cancels within your cancellation window, they will be notified that they will be charged for that canceled lesson. You, the teacher, will also be notified of the cancellation. You will be given the option to charge or not charge the client for the missed lesson. Note: Your client will be charged for a lesson canceled within your cancelation policy unless you cancel the charge.
* Deposit Information - Enter your bank account information so you can get paid! Most transactions will be deposited to your bank account within 48-72 hours. Note: Your first transaction can take 7 days to process.

**Setup Your Office Hours**
* The Office Hours feature allows you to show your clients when you are available to teach. Clients will be able to choose lesson times within your Office Hours from their Fons accounts.

_You can create multiple blocks of available time on a given day. This allows you to create breaks in your schedule. Note: You can book lessons outside of your office hours. Office Hours allow clients to see your available times._
