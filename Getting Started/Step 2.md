Now that you've set up your profile, let's take Fons for a spin! We’re going to add your first client and schedule a lesson. Fons shines at streamlining your business.

**Create Your First Client**
* Select the Clients tab and click Invite New Client. Enter name and email, set lesson rate and duration, and make sure their per/lesson cost is correct. Since you’re probably testing on yourself or a friend, you can make the lesson amount as low as zero. Remember, if the lesson amount is zero, your client will not be asked to enter a card or set up billing. A nominal lesson fee such as $1 is probably best.

* Check the send invite box and click Invite. An email will be sent inviting your client to join your Fons organization. Your client will receive the notification, agree to your terms of service twice, and enter their payment information.

* You can check to see if your client has accepted your invitation and set up their billing information by clicking on the client under Clients. Note: You can resend an invite by rechecking the send invite box and clicking save. _The date of your last sent invite will be next to “Send Invite.”_

**Create Your First Appointment**

* Create an appointment by clicking on Schedule, then finding the New Appointment button on the top left of your schedule page.

* Select the client you just added, and book a short lesson. We’ll do recurring students later, for now just do a one time lesson. You’ll notice that the lesson is unconfirmed, which we’ll look at in the next step.

* Then the lesson you requested can be confirmed. A teacher can check to make sure a lesson has been confirmed by clicking on the lesson time in their calendar, or noting the color change of a confirmed lesson. After that, all you have to do it teach!

**Confirm the Appointment**
* Now go back to your Clients page and select the client you just created, and click Edit Client. Now check the Send Invite box and hit Save.

* A notification will be sent to your client to set up a Fons account, and confirm the lesson you just booked! You’ll find it helpful to invite your current clients to use Fons with an attached lesson time as it makes their first experience easier and more understandable. 

_Note: Your clients must confirm lessons in order to be billed - unconfirmed lessons will not be charged! An unconfirmed appointment will be listed as such in grey in your Schedule to indicate that action from your client is needed to confirm the appointment._
