# How to Schedule a Lesson

Scheduling a lesson is a breeze using Fons:

1. Simply go the **Schedule** page, and press **+**. 

2. Select a student from your list of clients. 

3. Then choose a time, the duration of the lesson and if the lesson is recurring or a one time lesson. 

4. If your client is set up with a Fons account, they will be notified to confirm the lesson and the billing rate for that lesson.  

5. Once they are confirmed youâ€™re good to teach!
