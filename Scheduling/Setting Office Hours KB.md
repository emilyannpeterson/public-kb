**Setting Your Office Hours**

	

Setting your office hours lets students know when you’d ideally like to teach, and allows your students to request lessons when you have availability.  

That’s not all...

You can also schedule lessons outside of office hours. But students cannot request lessons outside of office hours. Think of office hours as outlining your "ideal week" of teaching times.  

Here’s the deal:

1. Go to your **Profile** page

2. Select **Edit My Office Hours**.  

3. Press **+** and select a day and time window that you currently teach, or would like to teach. 

4. You can also create multiple windows on a single day to account for breaks.

Why add breaks?

Well, before Fons, there were many times that I’d forget to schedule a break in teaching and I ended up with an eight-hour day of teaching without a single break! Those were doozies.

Teachers can also add office hours to multiple days at once, by selecting more than one day and adding office hours.  

Office hours will appear as a light blue window on your schedule.  

You can delete or change office hours by selecting an office hour within your **Edit My Office Hours** page.
