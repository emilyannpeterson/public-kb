**How to add a client**

Adding clients is simple using Fons:

1. Simply click on the **Clients** tab, and press **+**. 

2. Enter the clientâ€™s name and email address. 

3. Enter the duration of their proposed lesson, and the hourly rate you will charge for their lesson. 

EXAMPLE: if you have an hourly rate of $100, and their duration is 30 minutes, they will be billed $50/lesson.

4. If the invitation tab is green, your student will receive an email invitation to use Fons when you press **save.**

5. You can begin scheduling lessons once your client has accepted your invitation to use Fons, and created an account.
