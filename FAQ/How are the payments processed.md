# How are the payments processed?

There are two options for payment processing via Fons: Credit cards and ACH payments. Both methods are processed following best business practices and are PCI compliant. 

Note: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that ALL companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

Note: ACH payments can be processed directly from the customer's checking or saving account.
